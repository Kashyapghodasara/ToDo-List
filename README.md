# How to Create a Next.js App

Follow these steps to create a Next.js application from scratch.

---

## 1. **Install Node.js**
Before starting, ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine. Download and install it from [Node.js Official Website](https://nodejs.org).

---

## 2. **Create a New Next.js App**

You can use the Next.js CLI to quickly set up your app:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-next-app


Optional Flags:
--ts: Sets up the project with TypeScript.
--eslint: Includes ESLint for code linting.
--experimental-app: Enables the new app directory structure (if available).
--tailwind: Sets up Tailwind CSS.
```
```
npx create-next-app@latest my-next-app --ts --tailwind
```

3. Navigate to Your Project
After the app is created, move into the project directory:

```
cd my-next-app
```
4. Run the Development Server
Start the development server to preview the app in your browser:


```
npm run dev
```
By default, the app runs on ```http://localhost:3000```. Open this URL in your browser to see your app running.


5. Explore the Folder Structure
The generated folder structure will look like this:
```
my-next-app/
├── pages/           # Contains page components
├── public/          # Static assets like images
├── styles/          # Global styles (CSS/SCSS files)
├── node_modules/    # Dependencies (auto-generated)
├── .eslintrc.json   # ESLint configuration (if included)
├── package.json     # Project metadata and dependencies
├── README.md        # Project documentation
└── next.config.js   # Next.js configuration
```

7. Build and Deploy
To prepare your app for production, build it:

```
npm run build
```
Then, start the production server:


```
npm start
```
Or deploy it to platforms like Vercel (the creators of Next.js) for seamless hosting:
```
vercel
```
